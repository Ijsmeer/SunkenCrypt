<h1 id="the-sunken-crypt">THE SUNKEN CRYPT</h1>
<p><em>“It is a good thing you are here to take care of the witch and
her rotten bastards.”, the farmer said. “Death will have a new friend by
the end of day.” Rumors of hidden treasure and forbidden knowledge about
the Two-Headed Basilisk SHE have reached you. The voices speak of a
flooded crypt in the South of Kergüs. A treasure hunt never disappoints.
Your last silver pieces are spent and what is the worst that can
happen?</em></p>
<p>You heard one of the following rumors (roll d6 to determine):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is a witch living here that hoards treasure. (true)</li>
<li>The lost children of a nearby village are held here. (false)</li>
<li>There was a Misery fulfilled in the bog. (true)</li>
<li>The mists of the bog are deadly.(false)</li>
<li>Townsfolk claim to have seen vines come to life. (true)</li>
<li>Fire will blow up the bog.(false)</li>
</ol>
<h5
id="behold-now-the-endless-sea-where-leviathan-causes-waves-to-be-as-mountains.">4:5
Behold now the Endless Sea, where Leviathan causes waves to be as
mountains.</h5>
<p><em>A Misery was fulfilled here. A bark-witch and her root-children
live here now. They steal the belongings of the dead found in the bog.
Whenever one of the living plants trap lost souls, they pick the corpses
clean of their earthly belongings. And lost souls there are
plenty.</em></p>
<h3 id="entrance-of-the-crypt">Entrance of the Crypt</h3>
<p>A flooded entranceway to the Crypt welcomes you. The wooden door is
rotting, the walls are covered in black mold and the water reeks of
decay. There are D4+1 Trapvines hidden in the water.<br />
&gt;<strong>Trapvine</strong><br />
HP 5 Morale – No armor Whip d4 + special.<br />
<strong>Special.</strong> Agility DR12. When failed the trapvine drags
you to the ground and will suffocate you: d2 each turn as long as
Agility save fails.</p>
<h3 id="room-1-the-hall">Room 1 The Hall</h3>
<p>Your ankles are wet with water and unknown substances. It might be
blood, you hope it is not. In the middle of the hall there are three
paintings of deserts. A man is hung from the ceiling, his entrails
adding to the fluids in the room. You can hear wailing coming from an
unknown room.<br/></p>
<h3 id="room-2-the-dining-room">Room 2 The Dining Room</h3>
<p>3 Bark-children are feasting on what looks and screams like a woman.
They don’t like their meals being interrupted. Roll on the Corpse
Plundering table for loot. &gt;<strong>Bark-Child</strong><br />
HP 7 Morale 8 Barkskin -d2 Shank d4<br />
<strong>Strong as leaves.</strong> When more than 2 bark-children fight,
one distracts while the other stabs unless Prescence DR12 succeeds.</p>
<h3 id="room-3-the-provision-room">Room 3 The Provision Room</h3>
<p>Corpses hanging from the ceiling and laying around the room. The
stench is undeniable. In one of the hanging corpses you notice a
Trapvine glowing in a reddish color, feeding on its host.</p>
<h3 id="room-4-the-bedroom">Room 4 The Bedroom</h3>
<p>Runes are drawn on the walls. You find somethings to make you better
(d4+Agility HP), some trinkets and 2 Unclean scrolls.</p>
<h3 id="room-5-the-master-bedroom">Room 5 The Master Bedroom</h3>
<p>The Master Bedroom is filled with more trinkets and loot. 1 Unclean
scroll can be found here, hidden in the eye socket of a skull after a
Presence DR10 roll. Roll on the “Items &amp; Trinkets”-table for
loot.</p>
<h3 id="room-6-the-basement">Room 6 The Basement</h3>
<p>The basement is being used as a playground by 3 Bark-Children. You
can see a hopscotch drawn on the floor, a broken swing and a wooden ball
laying on the floor When they fail their Morale-test or when 1 of them
remains, they will alarm their Mother, The Bark-Witch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Bark-Witch</strong><br />
HP 16 Morale 10 Barkskin -4 Shank d4+2 /Scream d6/ Gift of the
witch.<br />
<strong>Scream.</strong> Toughness DR 12. If a creature fails the test,
it is deaf for d3+1 rounds. It cannot use Powers.<br />
<strong>Gift of the witch.</strong> When shanked succeed a Toughness
DR14. When failed you skin slowly turns to bark and you will become
Bark-child in d6 hours. The cure is to kill the witch. After the witch
has been slain, her victims turn back to normal.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="gm-take-note">GM, take note:</h4>
<p>The Witch is all-knowing in her lair. When the Bark-Children are
losing morale, roll a d4. On a 1 the Witch comes to defend her children.
She makes one shank attack and one scream attack. After this, she
disappears.<br />
The lair is flooded and the water can rise. Roll a d10 per room, when
you roll a 1 the water level increases; when you roll a 10, the water
level decreases. Start with water level equal to ankle-deep in water. To
increase difficulty: add a d4 enemies per encounter, take away the
scrolls and potions in rooms 4 &amp; 5, etc.<br />
This dungeon was partly generated via “One of the many bedeviled
dungeons”-table in the Mörk Borg-book.</p>
